# **Monte Carlo Bond Pricing Solver - Optimized Version**  

## **Overview**  
This solver estimates bond prices using a **Monte Carlo simulation** for short-rate dynamics under a simplified [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath%E2%80%93Jarrow%E2%80%93Morton_framework](Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model). It incorporates **algorithmic improvements** to enhance efficiency and accuracy while maintaining the same input-output structure.  

## **Algorithmic Improvements**  

### **1️⃣ Antithetic Sampling for Variance Reduction**  
- Instead of generating `num_simulations` independent random paths, we generate **half** that amount.  
- For each Brownian motion path, we also simulate its **negated counterpart** \( -W_t \), ensuring a more balanced sample distribution.  
- This technique **reduces variance**, leading to **faster convergence** with fewer simulations.  

### **2️⃣ NumPy Vectorization for Speed Optimization**  
- Eliminates slow **for-loops** by leveraging **NumPy matrix operations**.  
- Updates all short-rate paths in a **single step**, significantly improving execution speed.  
- Uses **cumulative summation (`np.cumsum()`)** for **faster integration** in discount factor computation.  

## **Benefits of the Optimized Solver**  
✅ **Faster Execution** → Vectorized computations reduce runtime.  
✅ **Improved Accuracy** → Antithetic sampling lowers variance.  
✅ **Better Scalability** → Efficient memory usage allows larger simulations.  

This improved solver provides **more precise bond price estimates** while maintaining the same input-output format, making it ideal for **large-scale financial simulations**. 🚀
